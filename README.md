## Welcome to SpinAuthenticator - User Authentication for hubspot.

### Discussion

For simple client-side authentication on hubspot, we provide a minimal Javascript library.
To add this library to your site, add:

```markdown
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://cdn.rawgit.com/rahulasati/auth/master/js/1.0.0/main.js'></script>
```

### Usage

We have developed this library to solve authentication solution for hubspot but if you're looking for simple client side authentication it will probably meet your needs.

This javascript library is intentionally small and minimalistic.
